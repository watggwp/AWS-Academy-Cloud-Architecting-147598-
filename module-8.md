# Module 8: Networking, High Availability, and Load Balancing (AWS)

---

## Question 1

**Which solution provides the MOST cost-effective backup connection for AWS Direct Connect?**

* ⛔ AWS Client VPN
* ⛔ Another AWS Direct Connect connection
* ⛔ VPC peering
* ✅ **An on-demand AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection across the internet**

---

## Question 2

**Which AWS service supports TCP traffic on port 42000?**

* ⛔ Application Load Balancer
* ⛔ Classic Load Balancer
* ⛔ Gateway Load Balancer
* ✅ **Network Load Balancer**

---

## Question 3

**Which architecture uses Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic?**

* ⛔ An Auto Scaling group launches EC2 instances directly accessed by users
* ⛔ Amazon Route 53 routes traffic directly to EC2 instances
* ⛔ Amazon CloudFront distributes traffic to EC2 instances
* ✅ **An Auto Scaling group launches Amazon EC2 instances, which are served by an Application Load Balancer. DNS name resolution points to the load balancer.**

---

## Question 4

**Users access applications from different geographic locations. If one Region becomes unavailable, traffic must fail over to another Region. Which solution should be used?**

* ⛔ Latency-based routing
* ⛔ Simple routing
* ⛔ Weighted routing
* ✅ **Geolocation routing with failover records in Amazon Route 53**

---

## Question 5

**Which service enables routing users to the nearest AWS edge location and improves global application availability?**

* ⛔ AWS Transit Gateway
* ⛔ AWS Direct Connect
* ⛔ AWS Site-to-Site VPN
* ✅ **AWS Global Accelerator**

---

## Question 6

**Which load balancing solution provides Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) traffic handling with ultra-low latency?**

* ⛔ Application Load Balancer
* ⛔ Classic Load Balancer
* ⛔ Gateway Load Balancer
* ✅ **Network Load Balancer**

---

## Question 7

**A company needs highly available web servers across multiple Availability Zones. Which design meets this requirement?**

* ⛔ Single EC2 instance with Elastic IP
* ⛔ Amazon EC2 instances in one Availability Zone
* ⛔ Amazon EC2 instances with static IPs
* ✅ **Application Load Balancer with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling across multiple Availability Zones**

---

## Question 8

**Which AWS service distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses?**

* ⛔ Amazon Route 53
* ⛔ AWS Global Accelerator
* ⛔ AWS Transit Gateway
* ✅ **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
